  "description": "This package was originally created as an async replacement for is-image-url.  I was using that one but my sync security scanner said there was issue with one of the dependencies.  I posted a pull request but a new version never got published, so onward and upward.  The other lib was synchronous, I figured I'd make an async version.",
